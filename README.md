##Summary: 
###Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional queries that you would perform to gather more weather data for June and December.
  Overall the results are showing the temperatures for the month as well as the high and lows. For the benefit of the shop i would run queries for each month to determine the temperature especially for more winter months as those would determine what the slow season would be. Another query would be to run a report for the whole year and see what the weather looks like oveerall for the past few years to determine if weather or climate change will impact the company in the future.
